  //2. payload contains basic attributes(claims) of the logged in user(id/name/email/token generated time(iat))
  //so this token is claiming that this user/their id/their name/their email
  //3. digital signature - generated based on the header + payload + a secret(private key) that is only available on the server
  //this prevents a hacker to modify the id to pretend to be someone else
  //because the moment you modify any of this properties, this digital signature needs to be re-generated
  //to generate the digital signature, the secret(private key) needed. and this is only available on server

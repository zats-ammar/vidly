//----better approach for form elements than using refs----
//in a form, input elements has it's own state for values
//it is totally detached form our component state
//we should get rid of input element state and totally rely on component state to achieve single source of truth
//to achieve that we need to convert these elements to controlled elements
//controlled elements are same as controlled components
//means that they don't have their own state. instead they get all their data via props and they notify changes to the data via events
export default LoginForm;

//in a form that inherits a parent form,you have to think of
//initialize state
//set the schema
//define server call once validation passes
//rendering the form
